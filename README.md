# basic-oop
Just a small repository with the purpose of exploring the basic concepts of programming using non-technical real-world examples, with the use of Typescript.

## Pre-requisites
There are 2 requirements:
- Have *npm* installed ([official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm));
- Have *typescript* & *ts-node* packages installed either globally or locally;
> $ npm i -g typescript ts-node

## Repository structure
Directories:
  - Each directory represents a topic with an example;
  - They are independent one to another;
  - Each directory has a standard executable file *main.ts*.

Playground:
  - Open a terminal in one of the desired directory and run:
  > $ ts-node main.ts
